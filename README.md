# Interview Check (Python)
Use this repo as a check to verify your local setup is functioning properly.

## How To Check

1. Familiarize yourself with the basics of how these interview problems work [here]()
2. Launch this workspace into a dev container
3. `make run` to make sure the program is executing properly
4. `make test` to run the unit tests.. uh oh, looks like some are failing!
5. Update the unit tests to go green, make sure things like intellisense are working. If not reload the window.
6. You've done it! Everything seems to be working for you!

If everything isn't working for you get in touch with your POC at Source Allies and ask for some help.
